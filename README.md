# P4-Superstore-Sales

## Context
From the [Kaggle Data Card](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data) section:

"With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, a Superstore Giant is seeking your knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments they should target or avoid."

## Workflow

Prior to any aggregation or analysis, the Excel Workbook "superstore.xlsx" has been converted to a MySQL database (superstore). Queries are made in filed scripts, which may alter existing tables or create new ones, but aggregrated data may be temporarily held in Pandas DataFrames to make visualization and further analysis easier. 

**This project is an ongoing.** 
Its purpose is twofold: learn by doing, and provide insights along the way.

## Goals

* Aggregate Sales Data 
* Identify top-performing products and regions.
* Investigate opportunities for prescriptive analytics
* Examine forecasting options
